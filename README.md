# Junk-File-Organiser
In today's digital age, desktop and download folders often accumulate a wide variety of unorganized 
files, leading to clutter and inefficiency. This project presents a Python-based utility titled "Organize 
Junk", which aims to automate the process of sorting and managing such files. The program 
categorizes files into predefined folders based on their extensions—such as documents, images, 
videos, audio, archives, and executable files—using a dictionary mapping system. Leveraging the os 
and pathlib libraries, the script scans the current directory, identifies file types, creates the 
corresponding folders if they don't exist, and then moves each file to its appropriate location. This 
tool enhances productivity by maintaining a clean workspace, reduces manual sorting effort, and can 
be easily extended to support additional file types or customized categories. The simplicity and 
effectiveness of this script make it a practical solution for users seeking to manage digital clutter 
effortlessly.
